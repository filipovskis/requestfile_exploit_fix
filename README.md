# requestfile_exploit_fix
The exploit works only for x32 servers which has `sv_allowdownload` convar enabled.
Basically the exploit just spams with the incredible amount of net messages to request files, the fix just limits the amount of messages in tick.
The fix requires sourcenet to work, check the releases section to download everything you need in a zip file.
